First u should run from Index.html file then it goes to slide.html and then it will open the fillup.html file then when u click ok on it it will open countdown.html to store these form dates it will use localstorages.
Remaining hey.html and hi.html files are just initial files for it the main routing files are countdown.html and countdown2.html files.
